I teach across several undergraduate and postgraduate programs, primarily at the **University of A Coruña (UDC)**, as well as in national Master's programs. My teaching covers topics in software engineering, large-scale data analysis, and artificial intelligence.  

### University of A Coruña (UDC)
- **Software Design** (2nd year, Computer Engineering):  
  Focuses on Java programming, object-oriented principles, software design patterns, and best practices in software engineering.  

- **Large-Scale Machine Learning** (4th year, Data Science and Engineering):  
  Covers distributed data processing and machine learning with **Apache Spark** and **MLlib**, as well as advanced topics such as streaming and federated learning.  

- **Computational Intelligence for High-Dimensional Data** ([Master’s in Bioinformatics for Health Sciences](https://www.master.bioinformatica.fic.udc.es/)):  
  Oriented towards Big Data, addressing scalable tools and frameworks such as **Spark** and **Hadoop**.  

### International University of Menéndez Pelayo (UIMP)
- **Big Data** ([Master’s in AI Research](https://www.aepia.org/master-en-ia/), UIMP, organized by [AEPIA](https://www.aepia.org/)):  
  Delivered as part of the national AI program, with a focus on methods for managing and analyzing large-scale datasets.  

### Supervised Bachelor’s Thesis
- **Federated Deep Learning on Images**  
  Development of an efficient and encrypted federated learning algorithm for unstructured data, with a focus on scalability, privacy, and performance trade-offs in distributed environments.
