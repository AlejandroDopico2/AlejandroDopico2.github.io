This July, I had the opportunity to attend the **AI Summer School ([EVIA 2025](https://www.aepia.org/evia2025/))**, organized by the **Spanish Association for Artificial Intelligence ([AEPIA](http://aepia.org/))** and hosted at the University of Oviedo in Gij√≥n. EVIA brings together researchers, professors, and students for a week of talks, tutorials, and discussions on cutting-edge topics in artificial intelligence.

As part of the event, AEPIA held its awards ceremony ‚Äî and I am proud to share that my Master‚Äôs Thesis, _‚ÄúEfficient Single-Step Framework for Incremental Class Learning in Neural Networks‚Äù_, was awarded **Best TFM (Master‚Äôs Thesis)**. üéâ

My work focuses on one of the core challenges of machine learning: enabling neural networks to incrementally learn new classes without retraining from scratch. The framework I developed avoids costly fine-tuning while still delivering strong performance, making class-incremental learning more efficient and scalable.

I am grateful to AEPIA and the EVIA community for this recognition.
